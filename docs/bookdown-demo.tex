\chapter{Overview}\label{overview}}

The goal of this book is to serve as a resource for procedures in the lab, tutorials on software and hardware use, and some other advice that I hope will be helpful (e.g., advice on scientific manuscript writing). My guess is that it will serve primarily to get people started in the lab, and also as a refresher on some details about data handling/analyis and use of some equipment.

This is a living document; it will never be ``finished''. We should update it regularly.

This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The \textbf{bookdown} package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"bookdown"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{# or the development version}
\CommentTok{# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): \url{https://yihui.name/tinytex/}.

See chapter 7 - Students

OK NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL GO IN THIS SECTION - UNDERGRAD STUFF HERE OR IN CH 7?

CK - All of it here?? That way it's together, and then ch 7 can be just for grad students and include things like program requirements, the checklist, etc.??

\hypertarget{undergraduate-students}{%
\subsection{Undergraduate Students}\label{undergraduate-students}}

There are two options for undergraduate RA's - register or sign the volunteer agreement. Each RA only needs to choose one or the other.

\hypertarget{registration}{%
\subsection{Registration}\label{registration}}

Registering for Directed Independent Research (PSY4912) has the advantage of putting research on their transcript. We almost always register them for 0 credit hours so they can avoid paying tuition/fees, but they can take more if they need to fill out their schedule to reach full-time, keep a scholarship, etc. The \href{docs/resources/Undergraduate\%20Registration\%20Agreement\%20Summer\%202020.pdf}{Restricted Registration Form} is filled out according to this template. IMPORTANT: Be sure the version you have is the most recent one (i.e., check with the program assistant, Mikala).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Grad student fills out the term/course \# (PSY4912) and the ``Assignments and Expectations'' section. The latter is completely made up; only the dates matter. The due date of Assignment 1 must be before the end of Add/Drop, and Assignment 3 must be due before the end of finals week (the last day of classes is safe). All else can go unchanged.
\item
  Undergrad fills out the form with their information and signs the document (by hand or with an e-signer - NEED TO HEAR BACK FROM KAREN COX ON REQUIREMENTS FOR ESIGNER).
\item
  Grad student sends form to the instructor/PI (Dr.~Bohil) to be signed and then sends signed form back to the undergrad.
\item
  Undergrad sends completed and signed form to psych advising (room: PSY 250; email: \href{mailto:Psychadvising@ucf.edu}{\nolinkurl{Psychadvising@ucf.edu}})
  Due date: Signed form must be delivered to psych advising by the end of Add/Drop.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{volunteer-services-agreement.}{%
\subsection{Volunteer Services Agreement.}\label{volunteer-services-agreement.}}

Students that opt not to register must sign the Volunteer Services Agreement. This brings them under the regulatory umbrella of UCF (i.e., liability insurance, ethics training compliance, etc.). See the \href{docs/resources/VolunteerFormInstructions.pdf}{volunteer form instructions} for guidance.
- Grad student initiates form here: \url{https://compliance.ucf.edu/enterprise-risk-management/university-volunteers/}
- Note: The faculty member (Dr.~Bohil) must be listed as the supervisor, not a grad student.
- Note: The forms previously were good for only one semester, as of Summer 2020 they are good for a year.

\item
  Install bookdown package in RStudio: \texttt{install.packages(\textquotesingle{}bookdown\textquotesingle{})}
\item
  clone the Lab Manual repo onto your computer \& associate the folder with a new R project in RSTudio (i.e., once you've copied the repo folder onto your computer, create a New Project in RStudio {[}with Git support{]} and assocciate it with the online repo URL as well as the folder on your computer that you just created (i.e., the clone of the online repo)). After that you should be able to open the project in RStudio, make changes and commit/push them to the online Github repo
\item
  Modify only the .Rmd files that correspond to chapters. If you need to add an image or file to link to, put it in the docs/resources/ folder. (e.g., see Sona, fNIRS examples in this book)
\item
  When finished, go to the Build tab (should be next to your Git tab) and select `Build Book'. If the book builds \& launches in a local browser, everything worked correctly.
\item
  Commit changes to Git using the Git tab, and push the changes to the Github repo

use ggplot2 package

Always do this before any statistical analysis. Look at the data to see what is going on. After that you can do statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA/regression, t-tests, etc.) to see if any obsered differences are large enough to be considered reliable (i.e., ``statistically significant'').

You should have plots summarizing each of your variables, as well as combinations of variables that are obviously of importance (e.g., block x accuracy)

Types of plots for variable types:
- 2 continuous variables (e.g., age, height): scatterplot (GGPLOT); line (GGPLOT)

1) - scale types: ALWAYS consider first!

need to know this for plotting and statistical analysis
2) - long form vs wide form data; transforming between these
important for plotting, ANOVA,
2.5) data assumption: normally distributed? y = data; completely unknown; normal? tests
3) general linear model
correlation; simple regression, multiple regression
\textgreater{} prediction- yes! causation - no!
\textgreater{} causation - need experiment (control timing of cause(s)!! (only way w obs data = SEM/BAYES NETS)
ttest logic
anova logic
ANOVA is a special case of regression with dichotomos predictors! (same mathematical model)
what is the linear model doing? linear equation + normally distributed noise
\textgreater{} assumption of the model - normally distributed data ==\textgreater{} the NOISE!! (unexplained variance part).

frequentist (classical) vs bayesian statistics
\textgreater\textgreater{} why? replicability!
\textgreater\textgreater{} problems w classical (multiple comparisons; null hypothesis not what we want, no peeking/cheating!)
\textgreater\textgreater{} problems solved by bayesian
\textgreater\textgreater{} is NHST/classical worthless? NO!! its just that bayesian seems to be BETTER (more reliable by avoiding some of the problems that reduce reliability in terms of reproducability (replicability)
\textgreater{} statistics is about REPLICATILBITY
\textgreater{} replicability is about what is true!\\
\textgreater{} we want to avoid publishig things that are not true! we want us (and others) to be able to replcate; bayesian may help us play it safer

so what do we do in stats? 2 things
1) estimation (e.g., mean, variance, difference between groups, learning rate, regreession coefficient)
2) inference (e.g., difference between groups? effect of treatement? theory/model 1 better than theory/model 2?)
note: both classical and bayesian apply the SAME MODEL!! GENERAL LINEAR MODEL
\textgreater\textgreater{} they differ in terms of how they ESTIAMTE the parameters of the model(s)
\textgreater\textgreater{} they differ in how we INTERPET THE RESULTS (i.e., make infernces from the data!)

\hypertarget{writing}{%

Some guidelines and advice on scientific writing.

\hypertarget{general-advice-1}{%
\section{General advice}\label{general-advice-1}}

Use R Markdown
* spell checking in .Rmd
* Creating a bibliography using .bib files

\hypertarget{start-writing-early}{%
\section{Start writing early}\label{start-writing-early}}

Write a short outline/draft of the method section when planning an experiment
* as you add details, add this to the outline (can be bullet points at first).
* IMPORTANT: If/When the experiment becomes a reality, write out the complete detailed Method Section right away - don't wait until after data collection is done and data is analyzed. You will remember why things were done better if you write it immediately. Also power analysis should be done for every study and reported here right from the start.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Introduction/Lit review - same as for methods. Work through the logic of your arguments and enumerate them, and their rationale(s) in an intro section BEFORE you run a study. You can wait to turn this into prose as soon as the experiment becomes a reality (i.e., is running), but then you should write up a draft of the intro/lit review/experiment overview/hypotheses sections and any needed theoretical sections (e.g., plan for statistical analysis of fNIRS data, General Recognition Theory section, etc.).
\item
  You can also put in a lot of the references at this time, and make sure your reference section is building correctly as you go!
\item
  Summarize all PLANNED analyses and write as much of this as you can ahead of time too. This will be more tentative in terms of the writing, but the analysis itself should be completely knowable before starting the experiment.\\
  In fact - your study variables imply what analyses you'll carry out (e.g., what the variables are, the scale of the data will dictate the statistical analyses, modeling analysis planned, ANOVA details)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{misc}{%
\subsection{misc}\label{misc}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  every study can be boiled down to a single page summary of results; we should always create this before writing
\item
  only write after the story is clear - the results are analyzed and evaluated and we've based our conclusions on them in the summary; then write the prose
\item
  list: honors thesis topics we'd like to see (will consider supervising these only)
\end{itemize}

on motivation, time, \& energy
\textgreater{} most important thing will also get the least external motivation -- research/writing
\textgreater\textgreater{} find a time to do this regulary; eg., 9-noon every weekday. no distractions! (phone, email, people).
everythign else you have to do WILL get done, because it HAS TO (nonstop external pressure to complete things): TA duties; class requirements; program requirements; talks/posters
\textgreater{} this is the most insidious threat to your success. if you establish only 1 good habit let it be this: set aside time every day that is for research (whatever phase of the project you are at). that's 15 hours/week. i suggest 1st thing every morning to get it done. then you can do other things with your day and relieves some pressure
\textgreater{} try not to make your problems other peopl'es problems: i.e., if yoiu have a big assigment, let your advisor know, but get in the habit of just planing ahead to avoid letting it disrupt your responsibilities to the lab for research.
\textgreater\textgreater{} even i struggle with this advice from time to time, but it has worked far better for me than anything else over the years
? do you want to know the secret to success in academics? that's it. i just told it to you. not that glamorous huh? but will you take this advice to heart and establish this habit? only you can decide. the biggest killers of productivity (and therefore success in academe) is distraction, time management, and dealing with stress. establishing this habit addresses them all at once. its the best advice i can give you. (I can lead a horse to water but I can't make it drink) make this an iron rule, and you will thrive.

  \textgreater{} year 4: overlapping subsets
  \textgreater{} never: separate circles
  \textgreater\textgreater{} authorship: using lab resources which i'm ultimately responsible for (this includes my time and effort in advisement); i'm not in favor of you doing something on your own without an advisor; if you want to work on a project with a different advisor, it needs my approval first. look at it from my perspective: trying to run this lab, need people who want to learn from me. if you decide this is not for you, let me know - maybe there's a different advisor. best not to go to them first. if youre not comfortable talking to me about this, talk to the program director (or above if i'm somehow the director at some point)
  \textgreater{} authorship: i'll almost always be corresponding author; maybe not when you're at end of training.

  From Director of Undergraduate Advising Karen Cox: ``The process is departmentally driven. So, the Advising Center helps with the admin side of things for the faculty. To make it easier for you.''
\end{itemize}

``You are welcome to tell students to send the forms to \href{mailto:psychadvising@ucf.edu}{\nolinkurl{psychadvising@ucf.edu}} after they have your approval, fill out their student info, fill in the assignments, and your signature is on the form.''

So it appears you need to e-mail the advising office for the form and attempt to fill it out. Dr.~Bohil can then approve it before you submit it.
