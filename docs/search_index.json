My guess is that it will serve primarily to get people started in the lab, and also as a refresher on some details about data handling/analyis and use of some equipment. This is a living document; it will never be “finished”. We should update it regularly. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. 2.3 General advice Don’t get attached to any experiment (or theory); just run as many as you can! Expect to be surprised; your hypotheses will often be wrong. We need to publish research, but desperately needing to publish something is a recipe for over-interpretation of results You can mitigate this to some extent by running lots of studies. Think of it like drilling for oil; its good to have a lot of wells going at once. "],

Look at the data to see what is going on. After that you can do statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA/regression, t-tests, etc.) to see if any obsered differences are large enough to be considered reliable (i.e., “statistically significant”). You should have plots summarizing each of your variables, as well as combinations of variables that are obviously of importance (e.g., block x accuracy) Types of plots for variable types: - 2 continuous variables (e.g., age, height): scatterplot (GGPLOT); line (GGPLOT) etc… Statistical analysis data analysis 1) - scale types: ALWAYS consider first! metric, ordinal, etc need to know this for plotting and statistical analysis 2) - long form vs wide form data; transforming between these important for plotting, ANOVA, 2.5) data assumption: normally distributed? y = data; completely unknown; normal? tests 3) general linear model correlation; simple regression, multiple regression &gt; prediction- yes! causation - no! &gt; causation - need experiment (control timing of cause(s)!! (only way w obs data = SEM/BAYES NETS) ttest logic anova logic ANOVA is a special case of regression with dichotomos predictors! (same mathematical model) what is the linear model doing? linear equation + normally distributed noise &gt; assumption of the model - normally distributed data ==&gt; the NOISE!! (unexplained variance part). how do do anovas/regression w software &gt;&gt; spss &gt;&gt; jasp &gt;&gt; R how to interpret &amp; report results (APA style; what to report; how to INTERPRET!) &gt;&gt; ANOVA &gt;&gt; regression? what if assumptions are violated? &gt; nonparametric statistical tests (robust to violations) frequentist (classical) vs bayesian statistics &gt;&gt; why? replicability! &gt;&gt; problems w classical (multiple comparisons; null hypothesis not what we want, no peeking/cheating!) &gt;&gt; problems solved by bayesian &gt;&gt; is NHST/classical worthless? NO!! its just that bayesian seems to be BETTER (more reliable by avoiding some of the problems that reduce reliability in terms of reproducability (replicability) &gt; statistics is about REPLICATILBITY &gt; replicability is about what is true! &gt; we want to avoid publishig things that are not true! we want us (and others) to be able to replcate; bayesian may help us play it safer so what do we do in stats? 2 things 1) estimation (e.g., mean, variance, difference between groups, learning rate, regreession coefficient) 2) inference (e.g., difference between groups? effect of treatement? theory/model 1 better than theory/model 2?) note: both classical and bayesian apply the SAME MODEL!! GENERAL LINEAR MODEL &gt;&gt; they differ in terms of how they ESTIAMTE the parameters of the model(s) &gt;&gt; they differ in how we INTERPET THE RESULTS (i.e., make infernces from the data!) Data modeling You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 4. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 4.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 4.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 4.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 4.1: Here is a nice table!

["writing.html", "Chapter 5 Writing 5.1 General advice 5.2 Start writing early", " Chapter 5 Writing Some guidelines and advice on scientific writing. 5.1 General advice Use R Markdown * spell checking in .Rmd * Creating a bibliography using .bib files 5.2 Start writing early Write a short outline/draft of the method section when planning an experiment * as you add details, add this to the outline (can be bullet points at first). * IMPORTANT: If/When the experiment becomes a reality, write out the complete detailed Method Section right away - don’t wait until after data collection is done and data is analyzed. You will remember why things were done better if you write it immediately. Also power analysis should be done for every study and reported here right from the start. Introduction/Lit review - same as for methods. Work through the logic of your arguments and enumerate them, and their rationale(s) in an intro section BEFORE you run a study. You can wait to turn this into prose as soon as the experiment becomes a reality (i.e., is running), but then you should write up a draft of the intro/lit review/experiment overview/hypotheses sections and any needed theoretical sections (e.g., plan for statistical analysis of fNIRS data, General Recognition Theory section, etc.). You can also put in a lot of the references at this time, and make sure your reference section is building correctly as you go! Summarize all PLANNED analyses and write as much of this as you can ahead of time too. This will be more tentative in terms of the writing, but the analysis itself should be completely knowable before starting the experiment. In fact - your study variables imply what analyses you’ll carry out (e.g., what the variables are, the scale of the data will dictate the statistical analyses, modeling analysis planned, ANOVA details) 5.2.1 misc every study can be boiled down to a single page summary of results; we should always create this before writing only write after the story is clear - the results are analyzed and evaluated and we’ve based our conclusions on them in the summary; then write the prose list: honors thesis topics we’d like to see (will consider supervising these only) on motivation, time, &amp; energy &gt; most important thing will also get the least external motivation – research/writing &gt;&gt; find a time to do this regulary; eg., 9-noon every weekday. no distractions! (phone, email, people). everythign else you have to do WILL get done, because it HAS TO (nonstop external pressure to complete things): TA duties; class requirements; program requirements; talks/posters &gt; this is the most insidious threat to your success. if you establish only 1 good habit let it be this: set aside time every day that is for research (whatever phase of the project you are at). that’s 15 hours/week. i suggest 1st thing every morning to get it done. then you can do other things with your day and relieves some pressure &gt; try not to make your problems other peopl’es problems: i.e., if yoiu have a big assigment, let your advisor know, but get in the habit of just planing ahead to avoid letting it disrupt your responsibilities to the lab for research. &gt;&gt; image: you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink &gt;&gt; even i struggle with this advice from time to time, but it has worked far better for me than anything else over the years ? do you want to know the secret to success in academics? that’s it. i just told it to you. not that glamorous huh? but will you take this advice to heart and establish this habit? only you can decide. the biggest killers of productivity (and therefore success in academe) is distraction, time management, and dealing with stress. establishing this habit addresses them all at once. its the best advice i can give you. (horse/water) make this an iron rule, and you will thrive. - another piece of advice has to do with energy/motivation (follow your energy) but that is another matter and is somewhat complicated by the constraints of working in your advisor’s lab, where projects need to get completed. projects/ideas &gt; venn diagram models &gt; year 1: they are a complete subset &gt; year 4: overlapping subsets &gt; never: separate circles &gt;&gt; authorship: using lab resources which i’m ultimately responsible for (this includes my time and effort in advisement); i’m not in favor of you doing something on your own without an advisor; if you want to work on a project with a different advisor, it needs my approval first. look at it from my perspective: trying to run this lab, need people who want to learn from me. if you decide this is not for you, let me know - maybe there’s a different advisor. best not to go to them first. if youre not comfortable talking to me about this, talk to the program director (or above if i’m somehow the director at some point) &gt; authorship: i’ll almost always be corresponding author; maybe not when you’re at end of training.
