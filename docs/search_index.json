["index.html", "CDL Virtual Advisor (Lab Manual) Chapter 1 Overview", " CDL Virtual Advisor (Lab Manual) Corey Bohil 2020-08-16 Chapter 1 Overview The goal of this book is to serve as a resource for procedures in the lab, tutorials on software and hardware use, and some other advice that I hope will be helpful (e.g., advice on scientific manuscript writing). My guess is that it will serve primarily to get people started in the lab, and also as a refresher on some details about data handling/analyis and use of some equipment. This is a living document; it will never be “finished”. We should update it regularly. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],

CK - All of it here?? That way it’s together, and then ch 7 can be just for grad students and include things like program requirements, the checklist, etc.?? 3.1.1 Undergraduate Students There are two options for undergraduate RA’s - register or sign the volunteer agreement. Each RA only needs to choose one or the other. 3.1.2 Registration Registering for Directed Independent Research (PSY4912) has the advantage of putting research on their transcript. We almost always register them for 0 credit hours so they can avoid paying tuition/fees, but they can take more if they need to fill out their schedule to reach full-time, keep a scholarship, etc. The Restricted Registration Form is filled out according to this template. IMPORTANT: Be sure the version you have is the most recent one (i.e., check with the program assistant, Mikala). Grad student fills out the term/course # (PSY4912) and the “Assignments and Expectations” section. The latter is completely made up; only the dates matter. The due date of Assignment 1 must be before the end of Add/Drop, and Assignment 3 must be due before the end of finals week (the last day of classes is safe). All else can go unchanged. Undergrad fills out the form with their information and signs the document (by hand or with an e-signer - NEED TO HEAR BACK FROM KAREN COX ON REQUIREMENTS FOR ESIGNER). Grad student sends form to the instructor/PI (Dr. Bohil) to be signed and then sends signed form back to the undergrad. Undergrad sends completed and signed form to psych advising (room: PSY 250; email: Psychadvising@ucf.edu) Due date: Signed form must be delivered to psych advising by the end of Add/Drop. 3.1.3 Volunteer Services Agreement. Students that opt not to register must sign the Volunteer Services Agreement. This brings them under the regulatory umbrella of UCF (i.e., liability insurance, ethics training compliance, etc.). See the volunteer form instructions for guidance. - Grad student initiates form here: https://compliance.ucf.edu/enterprise-risk-management/university-volunteers/ - Note: The faculty member (Dr. Bohil) must be listed as the supervisor, not a grad student. - Note: The forms previously were good for only one semester, as of Summer 2020 they are good for a year. 3.1.4 Graduate Students 3.2 Software You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 4. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 10.3. 3.3 IRB 3.4 Subject Recruitment 3.4.1 Sona Recruitment is done through the SONA system - see using SONA for a guide to setting up and running studies using the university subject pool. The SONA system is administered by Dr. Chrysalis Wright, and the primary point of contact (graduate student assistant) is Mark Crisafulli. Questions should be directed to Mr. Crisafulli (psych-research@ucf.edu). 3.5 General advice Don’t get attached to any experiment (or theory); just run as many as you can! Expect to be surprised; your hypotheses will often be wrong. We need to publish research, but desperately needing to publish something is a recipe for over-interpretation of results You can mitigate this to some extent by running lots of studies. Think of it like drilling for oil; its good to have a lot of wells going at once. 3.6 Modifying this Lab Manual (Grad students only) Install bookdown package in RStudio: install.packages('bookdown') clone the Lab Manual repo onto your computer &amp; associate the folder with a new R project in RSTudio (i.e., once you’ve copied the repo folder onto your computer, create a New Project in RStudio [with Git support] and assocciate it with the online repo URL as well as the folder on your computer that you just created (i.e., the clone of the online repo)). After that you should be able to open the project in RStudio, make changes and commit/push them to the online Github repo Modify only the .Rmd files that correspond to chapters. If you need to add an image or file to link to, put it in the docs/resources/ folder. (e.g., see Sona, fNIRS examples in this book) When finished, go to the Build tab (should be next to your Git tab) and select ‘Build Book’. If the book builds &amp; launches in a local browser, everything worked correctly. Commit changes to Git using the Git tab, and push the changes to the Github repo Additional notes: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ "],

Look at the data to see what is going on. After that you can do statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA/regression, t-tests, etc.) to see if any obsered differences are large enough to be considered reliable (i.e., “statistically significant”). You should have plots summarizing each of your variables, as well as combinations of variables that are obviously of importance (e.g., block x accuracy) Types of plots for variable types: - 2 continuous variables (e.g., age, height): scatterplot (GGPLOT); line (GGPLOT) etc… Statistical analysis data analysis 1) - scale types: ALWAYS consider first! metric, ordinal, etc need to know this for plotting and statistical analysis 2) - long form vs wide form data; transforming between these important for plotting, ANOVA, 2.5) data assumption: normally distributed? y = data; completely unknown; normal? tests 3) general linear model correlation; simple regression, multiple regression &gt; prediction- yes! causation - no! &gt; causation - need experiment (control timing of cause(s)!!

["writing.html", "Chapter 5 Writing 5.1 General advice 5.2 Start writing early", " Chapter 5 Writing Some guidelines and advice on scientific writing. 5.1 General advice Use R Markdown * spell checking in .Rmd * Creating a bibliography using .bib files 5.2 Start writing early Write a short outline/draft of the method section when planning an experiment * as you add details, add this to the outline (can be bullet points at first). * IMPORTANT: If/When the experiment becomes a reality, write out the complete detailed Method Section right away - don’t wait until after data collection is done and data is analyzed. You will remember why things were done better if you write it immediately. Also power analysis should be done for every study and reported here right from the start. Introduction/Lit review - same as for methods. Work through the logic of your arguments and enumerate them, and their rationale(s) in an intro section BEFORE you run a study. You can wait to turn this into prose as soon as the experiment becomes a reality (i.e., is running), but then you should write up a draft of the intro/lit review/experiment overview/hypotheses sections and any needed theoretical sections (e.g., plan for statistical analysis of fNIRS data, General Recognition Theory section, etc.). You can also put in a lot of the references at this time, and make sure your reference section is building correctly as you go! Summarize all PLANNED analyses and write as much of this as you can ahead of time too. This will be more tentative in terms of the writing, but the analysis itself should be completely knowable before starting the experiment. In fact - your study variables imply what analyses you’ll carry out (e.g., what the variables are, the scale of the data will dictate the statistical analyses, modeling analysis planned, ANOVA details) 5.2.1 misc every study can be boiled down to a single page summary of results; we should always create this before writing only write after the story is clear - the results are analyzed and evaluated and we’ve based our conclusions on them in the summary; then write the prose list: honors thesis topics we’d like to see (will consider supervising these only) on motivation, time, &amp; energy &gt; most important thing will also get the least external motivation – research/writing &gt;&gt; find a time to do this regulary; eg., 9-noon every weekday. no distractions! (phone, email, people). everythign else you have to do WILL get done, because it HAS TO (nonstop external pressure to complete things): TA duties; class requirements; program requirements; talks/posters &gt; this is the most insidious threat to your success. if you establish only 1 good habit let it be this: set aside time every day that is for research (whatever phase of the project you are at). that’s 15 hours/week. i suggest 1st thing every morning to get it done. then you can do other things with your day and relieves some pressure &gt; try not to make your problems other peopl’es problems: i.e., if yoiu have a big assigment, let your advisor know, but get in the habit of just planing ahead to avoid letting it disrupt your responsibilities to the lab for research. &gt;&gt; even i struggle with this advice from time to time, but it has worked far better for me than anything else over the years ? do you want to know the secret to success in academics? that’s it. i just told it to you. not that glamorous huh? but will you take this advice to heart and establish this habit? only you can decide. the biggest killers of productivity (and therefore success in academe) is distraction, time management, and dealing with stress. establishing this habit addresses them all at once. its the best advice i can give you. (I can lead a horse to water but I can’t make it drink) make this an iron rule, and you will thrive. projects/ideas &gt; venn diagram models &gt; year 1: they are a complete subset &gt; year 4: overlapping subsets &gt; never: separate circles &gt;&gt; authorship: using lab resources which i’m ultimately responsible for (this includes my time and effort in advisement); i’m not in favor of you doing something on your own without an advisor; if you want to work on a project with a different advisor, it needs my approval first. look at it from my perspective: trying to run this lab, need people who want to learn from me. if you decide this is not for you, let me know - maybe there’s a different advisor. best not to go to them first. if youre not comfortable talking to me about this, talk to the program director (or above if i’m somehow the director at some point) &gt; authorship: i’ll almost always be corresponding author; maybe not when you’re at end of training.

["psychopy.html", "Chapter 9 Psychopy for Data Collection 9.1 Getting Started 9.2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)", " Chapter 9 Psychopy for Data Collection Psychopy is a free open-source package for building experiments in Python that is developed and maintained by the University of Nottingham in the UK. It has been active since 2007, but recent updates have introduced a purpose-built solution for online data collection called Pavlovia. Pavlovia is a front-end for gitlab and allows for version control of experiment code. 9.1 Getting Started 9.1.1 PsychoPy A standalone version (no Python install required) can be downloaded from the project’s website. After installing Psychopy, the best place to start is with the PsychoPy documentation, which includes guides on getting started building experiments. Included with the initial download are several minimalist, functional experiment demos that provide a good starting point for building your experiment. 9.1.2 Pavlovia After installing PsychoPy, the next step in getting an online experiment running is setting up an account on Pavlovia. Note: In order for the account to fall under the UCF site license, the associated email must have the *@ucf.edu domain. Best practice is to use the email of the faculty member in charge of the lab. This ensures that the faculty member retains admin control of the account. The account username and password will likely need to be provided to students to allow them to develop and access experiments on Pavlovia, and the username and password need not correspond to the faculty email or any existing passwords. Notification settings can also be changed on Pavlovia to control where the various types of email notifications are directed. 9.1.3 SONA 9.2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) While many issues one might encounter are addressed in the documentation, keep in mind that, as with all free open-source software, PsychoPy and Pavlovia are perpetually under development and there will be bugs. Multiple resources exist to facilitate solving such problems – the PsychoPy Forum is home to a growing and very helpful community, UCF Psychology will be adding a private discussion board (to be added later) specifically for helping each other use PsychoPy – but ultimately the how-to of building your experiment falls to you, the researcher. A few common questions have, however, been addressed below, and suggestions for addition to this list are always welcomed. 9.2.1 Compliance Can I collect restricted data using PsychoPy? No. While the program itself allows for the collection of many kinds of data, including survey, the data storage of Pavlovia does not meet UCF’s InfoSec requirements for sensitive or identifiable data. What can I do if I need to collect restricted data then? Additional questions can be added to SONA’s intake questionnaire to securely collect sensitive or identifiable data. 9.2.2 Technical Is there a built-in component for providing feedback based on participants’ responses? Astonishingly, no. The way to provide corrective feedback is using the Code Component. An example of the Python code necessary is provided below. Note that the strings used are f-strings – this is necessary for successful translation to JS. In Begin Experiment: msg='' #msg variable just needs some value at start In Begin Routine: if not resp.keys: # failed to respond msg=\"Repeat trial. Use the labelled keys.\" elif resp.corr: #stored on last run routine msg=f\"Correct! \\n\\nAnswer: {AnswerName}\" elif not resp.corr: #wrong answer msg=f\"Wrong. \\n\\nAnswer: {AnswerName}\" In End Routine: (If repeating trials without responses) if not resp.keys: repeatTrial.finished = False # \"repeatTrial\" must be \"trials\" in the JS code else: repeatTrial.finished = True Why does my feedback work in Python but not in JS? The built-in Python-&gt;JS translator is good but not perfect. Be sure you are using f-strings Why are my stimulus image files not being read into my experiment for presentation? PsychoPy’s pathing is picky - be sure your image files (.PNG, .wav, etc.) are in the root directory with your experiment file (.psyexp or .py) and your conditions file(s) (.csv, .xlsx, etc.) 9.2.3 Miscellaneous "],

The goal will be to demonstrate (and develop) tools needed to a) format data, b) visualize trends in data, c) perform statistical analyses, and d) perform some more specialized analyses (e.g., computational modeling, fNIRS analysis). 10.1 Road map Introduction/literature review section should list: Study design, including independent variables (and their levels and measurement scale), dependent variables, and covariates (additional measures to either control for or examine correlation with primary variables) Each hypothesis and the basis for it (e.g., theory ,literature, our previous papers, etc.) Clear DIRECTIONAL predictions for variables included in the current research.1 Methods Results (confirmatory [i.e., planned] analysis first, then exploratory analysis if any) Analysis 1 (e.g., accuracy rates for each group; ANOVA main effect). Analysis 1 result. Hypothesis supported or not? Analysis 2 (e.g., Factor 2 main effect of levels?). Analysis 2 result. Implications for hypotheses? Etc. for each planned type of analyis for each variable (planned analysis, result, status of hypothesis based on this result) Describe any exploratory analysis conducted, findings, and implications2 Discussion/Conclusions. Summarize (in list form) your conclusions about the patterns found in the data and your conclusions about all hypotheses based on these data. Then consider any exploratory analysis conducted and its implications. 10.1.1 Project road map Intro/lit review Methods Results Discussion/Conclusions 10.2 Intro/lit review 10.3 Methods 10.4 Results 10.4.1 Experiment 1 10.4.1.1 Data preprocessing Read in data and organize for analysis. Data is usually stored in “Tidy” format, or you should put it into Tidy format after reading it in. This makes data easy to view and modify. However, Tidy format usually means the data are in Wide format. This is easy to work with and easy to examine. But for plotting and statistical analysis, you usually need the data in long format. So after reading in data and arranging into Tidy, wide format, make a copy of the data in long format to be used in visualization and statistics. Here are some examples of converting from wide to long format: [1], [2]; to see how to do this using the tidyverse, see section 12.3 Pivoting in R for Data Science None of this will appear in the manuscript of course. So all the R code chunks should include the tag ‘include = FALSE’, meaning the code and its output don’t show up in the knitted version of the paper. Note on lists: I recommend that for each experiment in the paper, you create a separate “list” object to store all the data and output specific to that experiment. If there is an experiment 2 reported, you may want to re-run a lot of the same analyses in both experiments. If you keep the same variable names across experiments, then earlier values get overwritten by later ones, which could create a lot of problems. After all analyses have been conducted, you should be able to examine the input and output values for each experiment reported. 10.4.1.2 Visualization 10.4.1.3 Statistical Analyiss 10.5 Discussion/Conclusions "]
