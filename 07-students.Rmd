### Volunteer form
1. Volunteer form
  - Before an individual can start his or her volunteer assignment, the departments must complete the Volunteer Services Agreement.  Go here for details and to access the form(s):

https://compliance.ucf.edu/enterprise-risk-management/university-volunteers/

2. If you want your voluneering to appear on your transcript, you must submit a URA form.
- We need to ask the undergraduate advising office for this form
- From Director of Undergraduate Advising Karen Cox: "The process is departmentally driven.  So, the Advising Center helps with the admin side of things for the faculty.  To make it easier for you."

"You are welcome to tell students to send the forms to psychadvising@ucf.edu after they have your approval, fill out their student info, fill in the assignments, and your signature is on the form."

So it appears you need to e-mail the advising office for the form and attempt to fill it out.  Dr. Bohil can then approve it before you submit it.
