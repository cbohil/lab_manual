# Getting Started in the Lab {#getting_started}

Essential resources and steps

## Paperwork

## Software


You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).



## General advice

1. Don't get attached to any experiment (or theory); just run as many as you can!
  i) Expect to be surprised; your hypotheses will often be wrong.
  ii) We need to publish research, but desperately needing to publish something is a recipe
  for over-interpretation of results
  iii) You can mitigate this to some extent by running lots of studies.  Think of it like
  drilling for oil; its good to have a lot of wells going at once.
