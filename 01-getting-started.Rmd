# Getting Started in the Lab {#getting_started}

Essential resources and steps

## Paperwork

See chapter 7 - Students

OK NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL GO IN THIS SECTION - UNDERGRAD STUFF HERE OR IN CH 7?

## Software


You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

## IRB

## Subject Recruitment

### Sona
[Using the Sona system](docs/resources/SONA new studies guide.pdf)



## General advice

1. Don't get attached to any experiment (or theory); just run as many as you can!
  i) Expect to be surprised; your hypotheses will often be wrong.
  ii) We need to publish research, but desperately needing to publish something is a recipe
  for over-interpretation of results
  iii) You can mitigate this to some extent by running lots of studies.  Think of it like
  drilling for oil; its good to have a lot of wells going at once.



## Modifying this Lab Manual (Grad students only)

1. Install bookdown package in RStudio: `install.packages('bookdown')`

2. clone the Lab Manual repo onto your computer & associate the folder with a new R project in RSTudio (i.e., once you've copied the repo folder onto your computer, create a New Project in RStudio [with Git support] and assocciate it with the online repo URL as well as the folder on your computer that you just created (i.e., the clone of the online repo)).  After that you should be able to open the project in RStudio, make changes and commit/push them to the online Github repo

3. Modify only the .Rmd files that correspond to chapters.  If you need to add an image or file to link to, put it in the docs/resources/ folder. (e.g., see Sona, fNIRS examples in this book)


4. When finished, go to the Build tab (should be next to your Git tab) and select 'Build Book'.  If the book builds & launches in a local browser, everything worked correctly. 

5.  Commit changes to Git using the Git tab, and push the changes to the Github repo
