# Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)

## NIRSPort 88 system (NIRX Medical Technologies, Inc.)

We have a NIRX nirsport88 mobile system, which no longer appears on the Nirx website.

Nevertheless, everything needed (data acquisition & analysis software, support, training) can be found on the NIRx website: 
https://nirx.net/

1. download analysis software & and read manual
- https://nirx.net/software
- https://nirx.net/nirslab-1
- NITRC site (where you'll actually download): https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=651

As you read the manual, try it out with real data (e.g., nirx.net has some data sets you can download if needed)

2. read this document on cortical functions for background on localizing Brodmann areas we'll be recording from using the International 10-20 system used in EEG
